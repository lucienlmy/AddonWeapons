# AddonWeapons
Modders create a lot of cool weapons for GTA 5, but they have to replace the standard models. AddonWeapons allows you to add weapons to the game without replacement and buy them in Ammu-nation in a separate menu. There are also weapons available and added exclusively in GTA Online.

Box of weapons is located in two Ammu-nations with a shooting range in Los Santos.

**The script finds new weapons automatically, just install them like any addon mod (like cars).**
